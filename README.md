# sales-dashboard-viz
Raw data in spreadsheets is difficult to interpret. The goal was to use **Data Visualization** to extract business insights regarding Seasonality and Category Performance.

📊 Sales Insights Dashboard (Data Visualization)

A data visualization project built using Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze sales trends, category performance, and profit correlations.

🎯 Project Goal

The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable visual insights. I created a comprehensive dashboard that answers three key business questions:

Trend: How are sales performing month-over-month?

Comparison: Which product category drives the most revenue?

Correlation: Does higher sales volume correlate with higher profit margins?

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python: Core programming logic.

Pandas: For data manipulation and aggregation.

Seaborn: For creating aesthetic, high-quality statistical graphics.

Matplotlib: For layout management (subplots) and customization.

📈 Visualizations Included

Multi-Line Chart: Tracks the growth of Laptops, Phones, and Accessories over 12 months.

Bar Chart: Compares the total annual revenue of each product category.

Scatter Plot: Analyzes the relationship between Sales Volume and Profit Margin, highlighting seasonal peaks (December).

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone


Install dependencies:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn


Run the dashboard:

datavisualization.py
